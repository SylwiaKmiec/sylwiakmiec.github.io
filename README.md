## Ebay-bidding prediction
#### Problem statement:
Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find
the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The price offered by anyone participating in this
process is termed as a 'bid'. A dataset is available at the following link and on Moodle for the bidding of
customers
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset <br>

Normal bids are classified as ‘0’ bids in the data set and anomalous bids as ‘1’. The goal is to use classification
to predict the bids in the future.
