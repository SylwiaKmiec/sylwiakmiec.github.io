# Ebay-bidding prediction
#### Problem statement:
Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find
the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The price offered by anyone participating in this
process is termed as a 'bid'. A dataset is available at the following link and on Moodle for the bidding of
customers
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset <br>

Normal bids are classified as ‘0’ bids in the data set and anomalous bids as ‘1’. Your goal is to use classification
or clustering algorithms to predict the bids in the future. You would need to clean and prepare the dataset
for the machine learning modelling under the following guidelines for Data Preparation and Machine
Learning modules.
