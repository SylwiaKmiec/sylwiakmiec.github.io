# Sylwia's Data Science Portfolio

# ABOUT
My name is Sylwia Kmiec I am a Data Analyst based in the Republic of Ireland. I hold a Bachelor’s in Accounting and Finance from the Higher School of Management and Finance in Wroclaw, Poland. 
Currently completing Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics for Business with Python programming language.
I have 14 years of experience working as a Credit Analyst analyzing data, reporting outcomes creating dashboards, and improving results.  Another aspect of my role was working closely with the technical department to improve processes, resolving issues, testing, and validating data, supporting system upgrades, and implementing new applications such as Oracle Business Intelligence suite, and new Oracle modules.
Participated in several projects: Jira ticketing system, Tableau server reporting package for Finance.
I have done several Continues Professional Diplomas level 8 such as Database Systems, Python for Data Management, and Data Analytics with Dublin Universities. 
I also have many passion projects that have strengthened my analytical abilities. I am searching for a data analytics position in Ireland. Please take a  look at my portfolio and send me an email with any questions you have about it, thank you.


## I. Machine Learning projects using Python

## [Project 1:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Ebay-bidding-prediction)
[link to the project:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Ebay-bidding-prediction)

## Ebay-bidding prediction
#### Problem statement:
Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find
the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The price offered by anyone participating in this
process is termed as a 'bid'. A dataset is available at the following link and on Moodle for the bidding of
customers
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset <br>

Normal bids are classified as ‘0’ bids in the data set and anomalous bids as ‘1’. The goal is to use classification
to predict the bids in the future.

## Performed:
- Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA
- Data Preparation
- Data Engineering
- Visualizations of key variables
- PCA
- LDA
- Machine Learning models:
    1. Ranodom Forest
    2. SVM
    3. Naive Bayes,
   All with hyper tunning.

## [Project 3:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Customer-Churn-prediction-Feature-selection-methods.git)
  [link to the project:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Customer-Churn-prediction-Feature-selection-methods.git)
 
#### Customer Churn predictin and Feature selection

Objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of the implemented Machine Learning models respective to our problem statement to analyse which features have the highest influence on customer churn desisons.

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>

Part 2: Building Machine Learning Model <br>

1. ML Model - Support Vector Machine
2. ML Model - Decision Tree
3. ML Model - Logistic Regression <br>

Part 3: ML Model Comparison

## [Project 4:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/titanic_kaggle.git)
[link to the project:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/titanic_kaggle.git)

####  **Titanic Kaggle competition**: The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
####  Performed:
   - Data exploration
   - Data Visualisation
   - Data Preparation
   - Data Engineering
   - ML models: SVM, Neighbours, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
   - ML tunning models
   - Models evaluation
   - Model comparison
