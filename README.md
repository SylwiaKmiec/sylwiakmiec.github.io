# Sylwia's Data Science Portfolio
<br><br>

## About
My name is Sylwia Kmiec. I am a Data Analyst based in the Republic of Ireland. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Finance from the Higher School of Management and Finance in Wroclaw, Poland. <br>
I am graduate of <b> Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics for Business with Python programming language.</b> Completed with <b> 1st Class Hons award </b><br>
I have 12 years of experience working as a credit analyst analyzing data, reporting outcomes, creating dashboards and improving results. Another aspect of my role was working closely with the technical department to improve processes, resolving issues, testing & validating data, supporting system upgrades. I was also involved in implementing new applications such as Oracle Business Intelligence suite and new Oracle modules. I played a key role in several projects: Jira ticketing system, Tableau server reporting package for Finance.<br>
I have completed several continuous Professional Diplomas ( level 8 ) covering Database Systems with MySQL, Python for Data Management and Data Analytics with Rapid Miner at Dublin Universities. <br>
I also have many passion projects that have strengthened my analytical abilities. I am searching for a data analytics position in Ireland. Please take a look at my portfolio and send me an email with any questions that you may have. 
Thank you 
Sylwia


## I. Machine Learning projects using Python

## [Project 1:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Eearthquakes_Volcanoes-Analysis)
[link to the project:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Eearthquakes_Volcanoes-Analysis)

# <b> How likely is it that an earthquake will lead to volcanic eruptions? </b>

For this project, the focus is on the analysis of earthquake and other natural disaster data
to learn about possible correlations and the relationship and impact of earthquakes on
other geological disasters. I would like to emphasize that the purpose is not to predict
the occurrence of other natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis as a
result of earthquakes. The intention instead is merely to add to the existing research and
work done in this field from a data analytics point of view. The objective is the application
of machine learning models to explore if their application can be a suitable instrument
for learning more about the relationship and interconnectivity. As per the research done
in this domain has shown an increase in volcanic activity in the local areas after
earthquakes. The idea is to use machine learning to detect and reproduce those observed
patterns in our data as well. 

Steps taken:
- Data collection, extraction from sources
- Initial data preparation
- Data visualization for EDA
- Labaling of data
- Data preparation for Machine Learning
- Machine Learning
- Findings and lesson learned.

## [Project 3:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Ebay-bidding-prediction)
[link to the project:](https://github.com/SylwiaKmiec/Ebay-bidding-prediction)

## Ebay-bidding prediction
#### Problem statement:
Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find
the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The price offered by anyone participating in this
process is termed as a 'bid'. A dataset is available at the following link and on Moodle for the bidding of
customers
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset <br>

Normal bids are classified as ‘0’ bids in the data set and anomalous bids as ‘1’. The goal is to use classification
to predict the bids in the future.

## Performed:
- Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA
- Data Preparation
- Data Engineering
- Visualizations of key variables
- PCA
- LDA
- Machine Learning models:
    1. Ranodom Forest
    2. SVM
    3. Naive Bayes,
   All with hyper tunning.
